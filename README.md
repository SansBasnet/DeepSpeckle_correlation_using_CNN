# Speckle correlation using Deep Learning algorithms on Newtonian fluids

This is a graduate thesis research of Sans (me) advised by Dr. Eric Landahl at DePaul University Department of Physics. We are developing and deploying a novel technique braching off from the traditional Dynamic Light Scattering or DLS technique. A Newtonian fluid has a predictable viscocity such as water, which is used in this experiment with various samples. 

Our research is in the intersection of classical mechanics and a Deep Learning model to interpret and classify the identity of the species present in a given Netwonian fluid. We are able to do this using a laser beam, a fixed fluid target, a double-pulse system and a detector without any lag. Such novel method gives us richer angular data and in-depth understanding of the sample via high resolution data that could be broken in pixelated form, a categorical data. Read the summary for more information about the experiment. 

Below is a partial picture of speckle produced with a sample with 490 nm latex cubes in suspension acting agent as an impurity. The image is a half of full image because of reductionality of datasize and symmetry of the image fulfills the overall input. The image is 1080 * 1920 pixels.
