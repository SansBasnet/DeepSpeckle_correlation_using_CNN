# Speckle correlation using Deep Learning algorithms on Newtonian fluids

This is a graduate thesis research of Sans (me) advised by Dr. Eric Landahl at DePaul University Department of Physics. We are deploying a novel technique braching off from the traditional Dynamic Light Scattering or DLS. 

Our research is in the intersection of classical mechanics and a Deep Learning model to better understand and classify the identity of a sample present in a given fluid. We are able to do this using a laser beam, a fixed fluid target, a double-pulse system and a detector without any lag.
